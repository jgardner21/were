## ReadMe
1. All code is original, the code located in the repository where the dataset is located was NOT used as a reference. The paper I implemented had no public code.
2. The code should be able to be ran in a standard colab environment, just make sure to specify the root directory and dataset filename as necessary.
3. The dataset used for the project can be located here: https://github.com/Smolky/hahackathon-2021/blob/main/datasets/hahackathon_train.csv
4. Training is done on the colab GPU, should take around 4 minutes per epoch
5. Epochs and batch size are set to 3 and 16 as default values, which I found produced the highest test accuracy.
